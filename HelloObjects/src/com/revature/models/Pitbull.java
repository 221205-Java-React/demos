/*Pitbull extends Dog... SO what?

First of all, this is a primary example of INHERITANCE in Java (one of the pillars of OOP)
This means that the Pitbull Class has everything the Dog Class has (fields/methods)
BUT, it can also have its own fields and methods unique to Pitbull
Pitbull therefore is a child class of Dog. In other words, subclass/superclass relationship
 */
public class Pitbull extends Dog {

    //Pitbull has all the members of Dog, but let's give it some unique ones as well

    //This is a variable unique to the Pitbull Class
    public boolean clippedEars = true; //we'll set it true by default, but this can change

    //method

    //talk overriding

    //constructors

}
